# Introduction

## Scope

This document describes how to reduce XSHOOTER data with the EDPS dashboard (Graphic User
Interface), the recommended infrastructure to reduce data from the ESO
telescope, using the new ESO Data Processing System (EDPS).
Details on the XSHOOTER data reduction stream and how to configure the reduction to meet 
specific scientific needs are also given.


For a more extensive documentation on the EDPS-GUI itself, consult the dedicated manual [here](../edpsgui/index).

For a brief description of EDPS and its main concepts, see [here](../edpsgui/intro.md/#what_is_edps).

For a detailed documentation on the XSHOOTER pipeline itself, consult the pipeline manual available [here](https://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/instruments/xshooter/xshoo-pipeline-manual-3.8.3.pdf).
