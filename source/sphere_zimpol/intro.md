## Scope

This document describes how to reduce SPHERE data taken in ZIMPOL mode with the EDPS dashboard (Graphic User
Interface), the recommended infrastructure to reduce data from the ESO
telescope, using the new ESO Data Processing System (EDPS).
Details on the SPHERE data reduction stream and how to configure the reduction to meet 
specific scientific needs are also given.
