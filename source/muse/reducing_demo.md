# Reducing demo data

Follow this procedure to quickly reduce MUSE demo data. We assume that the `EDPS` Graphic User Interface and the MUSE
pipeline and the demo data are installed in your system. For general instructions on how to install `EDPS` and the
pipeline, please
visit [https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipe_aem_main.html](https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipe_aem_main.html).

## 1. Setting the workflow
```{include} ../common/reducing_demo_1.md
```
c. Choose the `MUSE` pipeline from the list in the `workflows` field. The workflows offered in this selector depend on the installed pipelines.
The graphic workflow representation will appear as in
   {numref}`fig-wkf` under the 'Workflow' tab.
