# Introduction

## Scope

This document describes how to reduce EFOSC data with the EDPS dashboard (Graphic User
Interface), the recommended infrastructure to reduce data from the ESO
telescope, using the new ESO Data Processing System (EDPS).
Details on the EFOSC data reduction stream and how to configure the reduction to meet 
specific scientific needs are also given.

There are 3 workflows for EFOSC: efosc_imaging_wkf (to reduce only imaging data) and efosc_spectroscopy_wkf
(to reduce spectroscopic data). A third workflow, which is the combination of the 2, is also offered: efosc_wkf, to reduce
both imaging and spectroscopic data.

For a brief description of EDPS and its main concepts, see [here](../edpsgui/intro.md/#what_is_edps).
