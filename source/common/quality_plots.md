Almost all processing tasks can display the input raw frames and the products in the so called "quality plots".
By default, only the plots that refer to the products and the target task are generated.
If one is interested in the generation of other quality reports, change the "Graphical reports" configuration  in the 
configuration editor as the figure below.
