The data reduction of each dataset can be configured according to the scientific needs. In order to configure a
reduction, go in the `Reduction Queue` tab, which lists the datasets that are listed for reduction,
and press the button ![](../edpsgui/figures/configure_dataset.jpg).

How to open the dataset configuration menu to customize data reduction.
```

The configuration window appears (see
{numref}`fig-reduction_configuration_1` and {numref}`fig-reduction_configuration_2`)
It is possible to configure `workflow parameters`, that specify the strategy of the data reduction, as well as the
`recipe parameters` associated to each individual task. Predefined sets are configured, for normal scientific reduction
the default set `science_parameters` can be used.
The main data reduction steps for which one can modify the predefined strategy by editing the workflow parameters are:
