## Scope

This document describes how to reduce FORS SPECTROSCOPIC data with the EDPS dashboard (Graphic User
Interface), the recommended infrastructure to reduce data from the ESO
telescope, using the ESO Data Processing System (EDPS).
Details on the FORS data reduction stream and how to configure the reduction to meet 
specific scientific needs are also given.

For a brief description of EDPS and its main concepts, see [here](../edpsgui/intro.md#what-is-edps-a-namewhat_is_edpsa).
